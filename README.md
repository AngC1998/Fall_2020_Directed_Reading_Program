The [Directed Readings Program](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/about.html) pairs undergraduate and graduate students for a semester-long independent mathematical projects.
This semester, we studied the [Naïve Bayes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) for supervised binary classification and applied it to a classic introductory machine learning problem.
