The [Directed Readings Program](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/about.html) pairs undergraduate and graduate students for a semester-long independent mathematical projects.
This semester, we studied the [Naïve Bayes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) for supervised binary classification and applied it to a classic introductory machine learning problem.

**Description of the Project:**
- We cleaned and processed a dataset of passengers on the 1912 Titanic before implementing an algorithm. 
- We implemented a Naive Bayes Algorithm in Python to train, test, and anlyze the dataset. 
- We also implemented different types of graphs to visualize the data. 
- We programmed in Python, and utilized its Matplotlib and Pandas libraries. 
- In this project, we had an introduction to Bayesian Statistics, and learned basic Data Visualization.
